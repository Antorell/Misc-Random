00-libtorrent_Force_IPV4_hack
Force rtorrent/libtorrent to listen to a IPV4 tcp socket instead of a tcp6 socket
with an IPV4 mapped to IPV6 address. 
Fixes IPV6 peers/seeds that connect even when the "network.bind_address.set" setting 
is set to listen to an IPV4 address. ex: network.bind_address.set=345.346.359.356

00-rtorrent_IPV4_hack is here for consistency and shouldn't be needed. 


revert if you need ipv6 at some point. 


Note: this is a hack to avoid patching the whole source with #ifdef RAK_USE_INET6 macros.
