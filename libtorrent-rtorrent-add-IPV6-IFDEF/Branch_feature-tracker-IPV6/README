/!\ Untested /!\ #ifdef macros to completely disable IPV6
Untested yet. reintroduce the #ifdef macros to completely disable IPV6 in rtorrent/libtorrent 1.38,
files and patch created using rtorrent/libtorrent master/main branch and feature/tracker-IPV6 branch. 

Fixes IPV6 peers/seeds that try to connect and show up in the list of seed/peers even when bind_address is set to lisetn to an IPV4 address.
On a dual stack machine rtorrent will bind the listening socket using an IPV6 socket with an IPV4 mapped to IPV6 address and still accept IPV6 peers/seeds,
when it should be using an IPV4 socket to ignore/disallow anything IPV6. IPV4 isn't going anywhere anytime soon, and by the time rtorrent will really 
need an IPV4 mapped to IPV6 to bind to an IPV4 addess, rtorrent will surely be long gone.
